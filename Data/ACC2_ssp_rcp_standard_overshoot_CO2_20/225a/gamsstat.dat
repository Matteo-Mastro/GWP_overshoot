=C>>  ********** ACC2 version 3.1.0. *****************************************************************************************
=C>>  ********** CONOPT options ==============================================================================================
=C>>  * General strategy to use CONOPT options:
=C>>  * According to Arne Stolbjerg Drud (personal communication on Oct. 3, 2005) at ARKI, they attempt to creat a system
=C>>  * in a way that a user should not be concerned with options. Unfortunately, the state of the art for nonlinear
=C>>  * programming is not yet at a stage where options can be avoided completely.
=C>>  * But one should always try to start without any options and then add a few if they become necessary.
=C>>  *
=C>>  * Maximum feasibility tolerance: a constraint will only be considered feasible if the residual is less than
=C>>  * rtnwma times MaxJac.
=C>>  * RTNWMA 1.e-6 (default 1.e-3)
=C>>  *
=C>>  * Minmum feasibility tolerance: a constraint will always be considered feasible if...
=C>>  * RTNWMI 4.e-10 (default 4.e-10)
=C>>  *
=C>>  * Maximum Hessian dimension: if the number of superbasics exceeds lfnsup, CONOPT will no longer use the BFGS algorighm
=C>>  * but will switch to a steepest descend approach.
=C>>  * CONOPT2 and 3 react very differently.
=C>>  * There has been a problem for CONOPT3 where a reasonable solution (1 normal completion and 2 locally optimal) is
=C>>  * aparantly reached whereas there are some slacks left in the equations. When this happens, one should run the model
=C>>  * again and often a correct solution can then be found. According to Arne Stolbjerg Drud (personal communication,
=C>>  * Oct. 24, 2006), this problem in CONOPT3 will be fixed in the next version. He suggests that for now, LFNSUP be changed
=C>>  * from 1000 to 1500 or 2000. When the model runs, the 'NSB' column in the log-file has numbers around 1265 most of the
=C>>  * time. In order to estimate good 2nd order information, lfnsup should be larger than 1265. It seems to give some
=C>>  * speedup for the algorithm.
=C>>  LFNSUP = 2000
=C>>  *
=C>>  * Maximum Jacobian element
=C>>  * rtmaxj of 2.d7 led to warming, but that of 1.d7 went through.
=C>>  * The following choice is made by Arne Stolbjerg Drud experimentally.
=C>>  * According to Drud (personal communication on Oct. 3, 2005), the Rtmaxv and Rtmaxj options are necessary,
=C>>  * being related to large variables, which cannot be properly scaled automatically at this stage.
=C>>  RTMAXJ = 1.e15
=C>>  *
=C>>  * Internal value of infinity
=C>>  * My choice was 8.0E+07.
=C>>  * See the note above for TRMAXJ
=C>>  RTMAXV = 1.d50
=C*** Value Error line 38: Value brought in range for option "RTMAXV" saw "1E50"
=C*** Value Error line 38:    Value set to 1E30
=C>>  *
=C>>  * The optimization is stopped with a "slow progress" message if the change in objective is less than
=C>>  * 10*rtobjr*max(1, abs(FOBJ)) for lfnicr consecutive iterations when FOBJ is the value of the current objective function.
=C>>  LFNICR = 500
=C>>  *
=C>>  * Reduced gradient less than tolerance: the largest component of the reduced gradient is less than the tolerance rtredy.
=C>>  * default 9.d-8
=C>>  RTREDG = 9.d-6
=C>>  * The following is a quote from my email communication with Drud on Oct. 12, 2005.
=C>>  * Once a feasible solution has been found CONOPT will move in a direction suggested by the reduced gradient
=C>>  * until the reduced gradient becomes smaller than the optimality tolerance, Rtredg.
=C>>  * During this process the objective function must be reduced monotonically.
=C>>  * Sometimes, it is not possible to reduce the objective function even though the reduced gradient is not very small and
=C>>  * CONOPT will terminate with some kind of message about 'Slow convergence' and you will see NOPT with some variables.
=C>>  * Having a larger Rtredg will remove these NOPT messages, but it may also mean that CONOPT terminates too early
=C>>  * while it is still possible to get a better solution.
=C>>  * Slow convergence can happen for very large model or model for which CONOPT's scaling procedure does not work well.
=C>>  *
=C>>  * Maximum number of stalled iteration
=C>>  * Default 100
=C>>  * LFSTAL 100
=C>>  * LFILOG 5000
=C>>  * lfmxns 0
=C>>  *
=C>>  * Alternative method: It can make larger steps and therefore better reductions in the sum of infeasibilities,
=C>>  * and it is not very sensitive to degeneracies.
=C>>  * According to Drud (personal communication on Oct. 3, 2005), the lmmxsf option should be fine now.
=C>>  * This option has now been used by many users for many years without any error reports recently.
=C>>  * lmmxsf 1
=C>>  *
=C>>  * Upon slow convergence, increase rtredg and/or decrease lfnicr
=C>>  *
=C>>  * Triangular crash turned on as suggested by Drud (personal communication on Oct. 11, 2005).
=C>>  * lstcrs = true

 ** Warning **  The variance of the derivatives in the initial
                point is large (= 5.5 ). A better initial
                point, a better scaling, or better bounds on the
                variables will probably help the optimization.
